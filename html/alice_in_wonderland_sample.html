    <h1>Alice in Wonderland</h1>
    <h2>I. DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE</h2>
    <p>
      Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
      bank, and of having nothing to do.</p>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was
      reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book,"
      thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"
    </p>

    <p>
      So she was considering in her own mind (as
      well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
      making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when
      suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was nothing so very remarkable
      in that, nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
      "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!"
    </p>

    <p>But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its
      waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it
      flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket,
      or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it
      and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>In another moment, down went Alice after it! </p>
    <p>
      The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way
      and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping
      herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.</p>
    <p>
      Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty
      of time, as she went down, to look about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see
      anything; then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with
      cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.</p> She took
    down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed.</p>

    <p>
      It was labeled "ORANGE MARMALADE," but, to
      her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so managed to put it
      into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
    </p>

    <p>Down, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? </p>

    <p>There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself.</p>

    <p>"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!" (Dinah was the cat.)</p>

    <p>"I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.</p>

    <p>Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!"

    <p>
      Alice felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump!
      down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry
      leaves, and the fall was over.
    </p>
    <p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment.</p>

    <p>
      She looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage
      and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
    </p>

    <p>There was not a moment to be lost.</p>

    <p>
      Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say,
      as it turned a corner, "Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was close behind it when she turned the corner,
      but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.
    </p>

    <p>
      She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a
      row of lamps hanging from the roof.
    </p>
    <p>There were doors all 'round the hall, but they were all locked;
      and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other,
      trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
      wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing on it but a tiny golden
      key, and Alice's first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors
      of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was
      too small, but, at any rate, it would not open any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, on the second time 'round, she came upon a low curtain she had not
      noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high.
    </p>

    <p>
      She tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight,
      it fitted!
    </p>

    <p>
      Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage,
      not much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked
      along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
    </p>

    <p>
      How she longed to get out of that
      dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool
      fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh," said Alice, "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!
      I think I could, if I only knew how to begin."
    </p>

    <p>
      Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it,
      or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting
      people up like telescopes.
    </p>

    <p>
      This time she found a little bottle on it ("which certainly was not
      here before," said Alice), and tied 'round the neck of the bottle was
      a paper label, with the words "DRINK ME" beautifully printed on it in
      large letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'll look first," she said, "and see whether it's marked '_poison_'
      or not," for she had never forgotten that, if you drink
      from a bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you,
      sooner or later.
    </p>

    <p>However, this bottle was _not_ marked "poison," so</p>
