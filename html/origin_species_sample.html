    <h1>The Origin of Species</h1>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      When on board H.M.S. 'Beagle,' as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts
      in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the
      present to the past inhabitants of that continent.
    </p>

    <p>
      These facts seemed to me to throw some light
      on the origin of species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our
      greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might
      perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of
      facts which could possibly have any bearing on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      After five years' work I allowed myself to
      speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch
      of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that period to the present day I
      have steadily pursued the same object.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope that I may be excused for entering on these
      personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision. My
      work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three more years to complete it, and
      as my health is far from strong, I have been urged to publish this Abstract.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have more especially been induced to do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of
      the Malay archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that I have
      on the origin of species.
    </p>

    <p>
      Last year he sent to me a memoir on this subject, with a request that
      I would forward it to Sir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is
      published in the third volume of the Journal of that Society. </p>

    <p>
      Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Hooker, who
      both knew of my work--the latter having read my sketch of 1844--honoured me by thinking it
      advisable to publish, with Mr. Wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my
      manuscripts. </p>

    <p>This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. </p>

    <p>
      I cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements;
      and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been
      cautious in trusting to good authorities alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can here give only the
      general conclusions at which I have arrived, with a few facts in illustration, but which, I
      hope, in most cases will suffice.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one can feel more sensible than I do of the necessity of
      hereafter publishing in detail all the facts, with references,
      on which my conclusions have
      been grounded; and I hope in a future work to do this.
    </p>

    <p>For I am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this
      volume on which facts cannot be adduced, often apparently
      leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which I have arrived.
    </p>

    <p>
      A fair result can be
      obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each
      question; and this cannot possibly be here done.
    </p>
    <p>
      I much regret that want of space prevents my
      having the satisfaction of acknowledging the generous assistance which I have received from
      very many naturalists, some of them personally unknown to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot, however, let this
      opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to Dr. Hooker, who for the last fifteen
      years has aided me in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist,
      reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryological relations, their
      geographical distribution, geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the
      conclusion that each species had not been independently created, but had descended, like
      varieties, from other species.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if well founded, would be
      unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have
      been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly
      excites our admiration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Naturalists continually refer to external conditions, such as climate,
      food, etc., as the only possible cause of variation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In one very limited sense, as we shall
      hereafter see, this may be true; but it is preposterous to attribute to
      mere external conditions, the structure, for instance, of the woodpecker,
      with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue,
      so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the case of the misseltoe, which draws its nourishment from certain trees,
      which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which has flowers with separate
      sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one
      flower to the other, it is equally
      preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite, with its relations to several
      distinct organic beings, by the effects of external conditions, or of habit, or of the volition
      of the plant itself.
